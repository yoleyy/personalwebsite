&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;yoooo wsg good, names Youli Zildjian T. Ocampo, im currently living at the age of 15 turning sweet 16 on May 2, 2007 <br>
I am a Grade 10 student currently studying at General Pio del Pilar National High School, im just a normal law abiding student at our school<br>
in my free time after school I used to play games 24/7, I really enjoy playing games not until it gave me stress because of how I take the game<br>
to seriously so I stopped and focused more on my studies, not until this past christmas break where I had a change of hearts and started<br>
playing guitar again I promised my self when I was in grade 7 that I would not touch a guitar ever again because of how I got<br>
myself embarrassed in my class when I tried playing the guitar but since I got bored that christmas break I tried<br>
learning it again and I would like to say that im getting good with it:D although in exchange of that I<br>
stopped playing the piano since I got bored:/ but I can still play it. Im planning on going to<br>
law school after senior high, I wanna be a lawyer because I find their job very<br>
cool where they defend both the innocent and the guilty because they<br>
believe in the saying of everyone is innocent until proven<br>
guilty and that everyone has the right to be defended.<br>
